        <h1>Who Are We?</h1>
        <p>Cau√£, Renan, and Gabriel, a group of Greystone students who came together not just because we love to code, but because fate (and course assignments) demanded it. Bonded by our shared passion for programming and our mutual suffering in debugging, we embarked on this journey.</p>

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Bonded by our shared passion for programming and our mutual suffering in debugging, we embarked on this journey. This project isn't just another class requirement, it's our attempt to dive into the depths of Angular, hoping to emerge wiser, not just more confused. We're here to push our skills, break things (intentionally and unintentionally), and maybe, just maybe, create something that actually works.</p>

        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>"To create a <strong>To Do List</strong> so simple and effective that even we won't have an excuse to procrastinate (but we probably will anyway)."</p>

        <h2>Core Values</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Because overcomplicating a To-Do List defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Helping users (and ourselves) manage tasks without wasting more time making the list than doing the tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> The list will always remind you what you need to do. Whether you do it is another story.</li>
        </ul>
